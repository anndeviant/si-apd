# Material Request Template

This is a placeholder for the Material Request Excel template.

In production, this should be replaced with an actual Excel file (FORM_MR_Template.xlsx) that contains:

- Company header/letterhead
- Material request form fields
- Table with columns for: No, Item Description, Quantity, Unit, Image, Product Link
- Signature fields
- Date fields

The file should be placed in the /public directory as template-mr.xlsx
